name: Expander (experimental)
description: A block of content that can be expanded and collapsed.
accessibility_criteria: |
  The component must:

  - indicate that it is expandable/collapsible
  - indicate the initial state of expandable content
  - indicate where the state of expandable content has changed
  - be operable with a keyboard
  - be expanded by default without Javascript enabled
examples:
  default:
    data:
      title: Organisation
      block: |
        This is some content that is passed to the component. It should be distinct from the component, in that the component should not style or interact with it, other than to show and hide it.
  expand_by_default:
    description: Shows the content by default. It can still be hidden.
    data:
      title: Location
      open_on_load: true
      block: |
        This is some content that is passed to the component. It should be distinct from the component, in that the component should not style or interact with it, other than to show and hide it.
  with_margin_bottom:
    description: The component accepts a number for margin bottom from 0 to 9 (0px to 60px) using the [GOV.UK Frontend spacing scale](http://govuk-frontend-review.herokuapp.com/docs/#settings/spacing-variable-govuk-spacing-points). It defaults to a margin bottom of 0.
    data:
      title: Person

      block: |
        This is some content that is passed to the component. It should be distinct from the component, in that the component should not style or interact with it, other than to show and hide it.
  with_counter:
    description: If there are form elements within the expander it can display a count of the number of form elements with a selected or input value. This is to make it appear the same as the option select component when appearing with it in search pages. Note that if any form elements are selected on page load, the component will expand by default.

      title: Things
      block: |
