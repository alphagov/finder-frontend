# EU Exit Readiness Business Finder Email signup

Currently only the [EU Exit Business Readiness Finder](https://www.gov.uk/find-eu-exit-guidance-business) is making use of these features, but other finders could use these in the future.

## Subscribing to multiple facet values

Users can [pick and choose which `facet_values` ('links') to subscribe to](https://github.com/alphagov/finder-frontend/pull/1191/commits/9abe85dbedc9562accb299bab5f9a224786e1ebe), and will be emailed when content tagged to _any_ of the `facet_values` is published or has a major update.

So, if a user has subscribed to updates about `Aerospace` or `EU Citizens`, and a piece of content linked only to `EU Citizens` is updated, an email will be sent. This functionality is described in the [email-alert-api documentation](https://github.com/alphagov/email-alert-api/blob/master/doc/matching-content-to-subscriber-lists.md).

The titles for email subscriber lists are usually generated by concatenating the list of all of the facets the user has selected. This is fine for finders where users can only subscribe to a few facets, but in the business finder this list could get very long. To make the subscription title easier to read, the business finder creates title with a [comma-separated list of facets](https://github.com/alphagov/finder-frontend/commit/f538171b0a90a63674e8d6869ce17b2dfaa69099).
